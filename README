Project on improving match making algorithm in semantic web service discovery (SOA)

About :

generateServiceLibrary.cpp

Creates a service library in serviceLibrary.txt with its operation interfaces annotated randomly from the set of raw words in source.txt

matchmake.cpp

Gets in input and output annotations to be matched and results a best matched service from the service library generated using following algorithms :
(i)	Paolucci Algorithm
(ii)	BruteForce Combinatorial Algorithm
(iii)	Assignment Algorithm

Prerequisites :
g++ 4.4.3 compiler
